####⚡️This is Cinema project for applying Data Structure.\
####⚡️This project aimed to implement data structure as LinkedList, Queue, Stack, Binary Search Tree from scratch by using Python\

### Project specification, implement data structure to solve project problem

Imagine you are running a small independent cinema. You have a single screening room, 
and show a single movie each day, for which customers can buy tickets. There is no reserved 
seating: customers just buy a ticket (within room capacity) and can seat anywhere. There is 
no advance booking system. If there is no ticket available for the next session, customers 
just have to come back another day. Customers like the informal character of your cinema, 
and do not seem to mind the lack of a booking option.
When customers arrive to the cinema, they wait in line to be served. Once their turn has 
arrived, you check that they exist in the system. If not, a new profile is created. Then, a 
ticket is sold (if seats are still available). If the movie is sold out, all customers are told to 
leave.
You receive new movies at random times, and store them in your collection. Because the 
schedule for new arrivals is quite irregular, you like to always screen the most recent movie.
After the movie has been shown once, it is discarded. In case no new movie has arrived in 
a while, you always keep a copy of your favourite movie somewhere safe, as a backup.
You need your system to allow you to add or remove customers and their information 
(name, phone number, payment method). You also store how many screenings they have 
attended, because after 10 screenings they get a free ticket.
